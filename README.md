Sales Prediction Model

This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast sales based on historical data, leveraging machine learning techniques. The goal is to help businesses optimize inventory, marketing strategies, and resource allocation by accurately predicting future sales.

Key Features:
Data Analysis: Cleaned and preprocessed sales data, handling missing values and outliers, and created new time-based features to enhance prediction accuracy.
Modeling: Implemented multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to forecast future sales.
Evaluation: Compared model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² to select the best model.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilized RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune model parameters, further improving predictive accuracy.
Visualization: Generated insightful visualizations to illustrate sales trends over time and model predictions.
This project demonstrates the application of advanced machine learning techniques to solve real-world business challenges, ultimately improving decision-making in sales management.
